## What is the syllabus?

The course consists in four units. Each unit is made up of a theory section, which also lists resources/papers, and two *notebooks*. More specifically, we have:
- Unit 1: Introduction to diffusion models  
Introduction to 🤗 Diffusers and implementation from 0
- Unit 2: Finetuning and guidance  
Finetuning a diffusion model on new data and adding guidance.
- Unit 3: Stable Diffusion  
Exploring a powerful text-conditioned latent diffusion model
- Unit 4: Doing more with diffusion  
Advanced techniques for going further with diffusion
