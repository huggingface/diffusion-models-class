In this free course, you will:
- 👩‍🎓 Study the theory behind diffusion models
- 🧨 Learn how to generate images and audio with the popular 🤗 Diffusers library
- 🏋️‍♂️ Train your own diffusion models from scratch
- 📻 Fine-tune existing diffusion models on new datasets
- 🗺 Explore conditional generation and guidance
- 🧑‍🔬 Create your own custom diffusion model pipelines

## FAQ
**Is this class free?**

Yes, totally free 🥳.


**Do I need to have a Hugging Face account to follow the course?**

Yes, to push your custom models and pipelines to the hub, you need an account (it's free) 🤗.

You can create one here 👉 [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join)


**What’s the format of the class?**

The course will consist of at least **4 Units.** More will be added as time goes on, on topics like diffusion for audio. 

Each unit consists of some theory and background alongisde one or more hands-on notebooks. Some units will also contain suggested projects and we'll have competitions and swag for the best pipelines and demos (more details TDB).

## 🌎 Languages and translations

Members of the 🤗 community have begin translating the course! We're planning to host this course on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/), so if you're interested in contributing a translation, we recommend waiting until we've formatted the English content in it's final form.
